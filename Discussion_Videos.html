<ul>
    <li>The textbook of this class is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Interest-Theory-Third-Textbooks/dp/1470443937/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1585631099&refinements=p_27%3AJames+W.+Daniel&s=books&sr=1-2&text=James+W.+Daniel">this</a> one.</li>
    <li>Grading of this class will be 30% HW and 35% each on midterm and final. HW will be collected via email. </li>
    <li>A few examples that explain the basics of interest rate, and a very brief overview of what to expect over this course. </li>
    <li>There are various ways to measure interest rate, depends on how you compute compound interest, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_notation#Interest_rates"> here</a> for detail (You don't need to understand all for now). </li>
    <li>One example of how to deal with an agreement with multiple cash flows on a fixed interest rate.</li> 
</ul>
<a href="133C_04012020.mp4" download>133C discussion 04012020</a>
<ul>
    <li>Discuss accumulation function, amount function, discount function</li>
    <li>Different way to measure interest, and how to convert them to each other: effective rate of interest, effective rate of discount, force of interest</li>
    <li>Examples from textbook chapter 1 and bank saving account
</ul>
<a href="133C_04062020.mp4" download>133C discussion 04062020</a>
<ul>
    <li>Different measure of interests, and how to convert between them.</li>
    <li>Example from Ch1 Problems</li>
</ul>
<a href="133C_04082020.mp4" download>133C discussion 04082020</a>
<ul>
    <li>More on conversion between different measure of interest rate, and their relative orders</li>
    <li>Problems from later half of Ch1</li>
</ul>
<a href="133C_04132020.mp4" download>133C discussion 04132020</a>
<ul>
    <li>Some problems in HW2</li>
</ul>
<a href="133C_04152020.mp4" download>133C discussion 04152020</a>
<ul>
    <li>Some problems in Ch2, examples of financial agreements with multiple cash flows and a fixed interest rate</li>
    <li>Briefly discuss what is "Rule of 72"</li>
    <li>Correct an error I made last time: discount rate at 6th year, d_6 should be (a(6)-a(5))/a(6) where a is the accumulation function. It is not the discount rate converted from force of interest at t=6.</li>
</ul>
<a href="133C_04202020.mp4" download>133C discussion 04152020</a>
<ul>
    <li>Go over time value of money practice problems on Professor's handout. I made numerical mistake on problem 3 so disregard the final answer (but hopefully the equation setup is still correct!).</li>
</ul>

<h3> 133B </h3>
<a href="133B_03312020.mp4" download>133B discussion 03312020</a>
<ul>
    <li>We review what is European Put&Call Option.</li>
    <li>We make a few ideal assumptions about the market (no transaction cost, no bid-ask spread, can borrow/deposit at risk free rate).</li>
    <li>We make the assumption that the market is efficient so no arbitrage profit can be made.</li>
    <li>We use no arbitrage principle to make a few conclusions: put-call parity equation, monotonicity and convexity of Put&Call option price with respect to strike price.</li>
</ul>
<a href="133B_04022020.mp4" download>133B discussion 04022020</a>
<ul>
    <li>Problem 9.8: Monotone in(de)creasing of put(call) option price with respect to strike price is violated: Use credit spread to get arbitrage.</li>
    <li>Problem 9.9: An equation derivied from put-call parity is violated: Use box spread to get arbitrage (Initially I mistakenly called it butterfly spread in the video, sorry about that).</li>
    <li>Problem 9.10: Convexity is violated: Use butterfly spread to get arbitrage.</li>
    <li>We discuss how to modify put-call parity equation when the stock is paying continuous and discrete dividend that can be applied to problem 9.1-9.3 (but run out of time to go over these problems).</li>
    </ul>
<a href="133B_04072020.mp4" download>133B discussion 04072020</a>
<ul>
    <li>Review the detail of 1 step binomial pricing model, risk neutral probability</li>
    <li>Problem 10.1</li>
</ul>
<a href="133B_04092020.mp4" download>133B discussion 04092020</a>
<ul>
    <li>Use 2 steps binomial pricing model to price European and American Options</li>
    <li>Problem 10.6, 10.10 (and an example modify the strike to 100 to see the difference between European and American Put)</li>
</ul>
<a href="133B_04142020.mp4" download>133B discussion 04142020</a>
<ul>
    <li>Review parameters in 1 period binomial pricing, go over Quiz2 problem 3,4,5,8</li>
    <li>Textbook problem 11.1, use binomial model to price american option</li>
    <li>Use Put-Call parity to explain how strike price affects the possibility of early exercise</li>
</ul>
<a href="133B_04162020.mp4" download>133B discussion 04162020</a>
<ul>
    <li>Use Put-Call parity relative pricing to take a look at when early exercise of American Option happenes.</li>
    <li>Conclusion: It happenes when option is deep in the money(exact numbers depend on other parameters).</li>
    <li>Never early exercise call when stock is non-dividend, never early exercise put when risk free rate on cash is 0.</li>
    <li>Problem 11.4</li>
</ul>
