    <li>The textbook of this class is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Interest-Theory-Third-Textbooks/dp/1470443937/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1585631099&refinements=p_27%3AJames+W.+Daniel&s=books&sr=1-2&text=James+W.+Daniel">this</a> one.</li>
    <li>Grading of this class will be 30% HW and 35% each on midterm and final. HW will be collected via email. </li>
    <li>A few examples that explain the basics of interest rate, and a very brief overview of what to expect over this course. </li>
    <li>There are various ways to measure interest rate, depends on how you compute compound interest, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_notation#Interest_rates"> here</a> for detail (You don't need to understand all for now). </li>
    <li>One example of how to deal with an agreement with multiple cash flows on a fixed interest rate.</li> 
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Discuss accumulation function, amount function, discount function</li>
    <li>Different way to measure interest, and how to convert them to each other: effective rate of interest, effective rate of discount, force of interest</li>
    <li>Examples from textbook chapter 1 and bank saving account

<ul>
    <li>Some problems in Ch2, examples of financial agreements with multiple cash flows and a fixed interest rate</li>
    <li>Briefly discuss what is "Rule of 72"</li>
    <li>Correct an error I made last time: discount rate at 6th year, d_6 should be (a(6)-a(5))/a(6) where a is the accumulation function. It is not the discount rate converted from force of interest at t=6.</li>

    <li>Go over time value of money practice problems on Professor's handout. I made numerical mistake on problem 3 so disregard the final answer (but hopefully the equation setup is still correct!).</li>
