    <li>The textbook of this class is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Interest-Theory-Third-Textbooks/dp/1470443937/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1585631099&refinements=p_27%3AJames+W.+Daniel&s=books&sr=1-2&text=James+W.+Daniel">this</a> one.</li>
    <li>Grading of this class will be 30% HW and 35% each on midterm and final. HW will be collected via email. </li>
    <li>A few examples that explain the basics of interest rate, and a very brief overview of what to expect over this course. </li>
    <li>There are various ways to measure interest rate, depends on how you compute compound interest, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_notation#Interest_rates"> here</a> for detail (You don't need to understand all for now). </li>

<ul>
    <li>We review what is European Put&Call Option.</li>
    <li>We make a few ideal assumptions about the market (no transaction cost, no bid-ask, can borrow/deposit at risk free rate).</li>
    <li>We make the assumption that the market is efficient so no arbitrage profit can be made.</li>
    <li>We use no arbitrage principle to make a few conclusions: put-call parity equation, monotonicity and convexity of Put&Call option price with respect to strike price.</li>
