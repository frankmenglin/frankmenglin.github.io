    <h2>Let's play a modified split steal game</h2>
    <p> The original version of the game came from the show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Balls#:~:text=The%20contestants%20may%20speak%20to,Split%20contestant%20leaves%20with%20nothing.">golden ball</a>.
    The final 2 players compete for a prize. Each player can choose "split" or "steal".<br> If both choose "split", the prize gets split evenly between two players. If one player chooses "steal", that player wins the whole prize (and the other gets nothing).
    If both players steal, both players get nothing (the show producer takes back the money).<br><br>

    Here you are going to play a modified version of the game. Besides "split" and "steal", I add an addtional option "catch" to the game. It means you attempt to catch your opponent who might steal.
    If two players make different choices. The payoff is like rock paper scissors. "steal" beats "split", "split" beats "catch", "catch" beats "steal". Winner takes all (2 points), loser takes nothing.
    If two players make the same choices. Players split the prize evenly if they both choose "split". Otherwise (both steal or both catch) both players get nothing.
